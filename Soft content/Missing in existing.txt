🧩 What these don’t do yet (but your app could)

Current apps fall short in:

Truly autonomous long-term planning (not just suggestions)

Deep pattern learning about your habits

Multi-constraint scheduling (like: “Don’t schedule work after 6pm unless tasks urgent”)

AI that plans, tweaks, and retaliates when you ignore it

Unified mobile + AI agent without web/desktop glue logic

Basically: current apps are helpers. None are your personal scheduling engineer that learns and optimizes automatically.
